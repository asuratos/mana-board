# The Mana Board

![PXL_20230704_000348086](https://github.com/asuratos/mana-board/assets/7587003/8a491a3b-54fb-499c-acce-500b29e18667)

A small, simple leverless controller. Powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico running [GP2040-CE](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE).

Named as such because the the shape reminded me of a cutting board (Japanese:まな板 ***mana**-ita*).
